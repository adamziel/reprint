# Site Export WordPress Plugin

## API Routing

Many shared hosts (SiteGround, GoDaddy, etc.) block direct PHP execution inside `wp-content/plugins/` at the web server level, returning a 403 before the request ever reaches PHP. To work around this, export API requests are routed through WordPress's front controller (`index.php` at the site root), which hosts never block.

### How it works

The plugin file (`index.php`) is `include`'d by WordPress during its plugin loading loop — this happens *before* the `plugins_loaded` hook fires, making it the earliest interception point available to a regular plugin.

When a request arrives at `https://example.com/?site-export-api`, the plugin:

1. Detects `$_GET['site-export-api']` during plugin file load
2. Reverts WordPress error display settings (`display_errors`, `html_errors`) that `wp_debug_mode()` may have turned on
3. Clears any output buffering WordPress started
4. Sets up error handlers, HMAC auth, and runs the export endpoint
5. Calls `exit` — WordPress never finishes booting

This gives us a clean execution environment while using WordPress's front controller as the entry point.
