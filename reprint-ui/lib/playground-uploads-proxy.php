// Earlier we filtered option_home / option_siteurl down to scheme://host
// to dodge a doubled /scope:<slug>/ in asset URLs — but stripping the
// scope from home_url() also strips it from <a href> links, so every
// click navigates out of the iframe scope and lands on Playground's
// "Page not found" page. The Atomic-versioned-plugin layout fix in
// the activation step already collapses the path mismatch that was
// behind the visible doubling, so we leave WP's URL output alone now.

// page-optimize is deactivated at db-apply time by reprint's
// deactivate_path_incompatible_plugins() — its concat-css/js URL
// builder doubles Playground's /scope:<slug>/ prefix into hrefs
// that 404. Belt-and-braces: also disable Jetpack's frontend CSS
// imploder (same family of asset bundling that needs Atomic-side
// route handlers).

// We PROXY here, not 302 to the source. Playground's service worker
// post-processes Location headers to keep the iframe in scope, so a
// Location pointing at https://adamadam.blog/wp-content/... comes
// back as https://adamadam.blog/scope:foo/wp-content/...; the
// browser follows it, the SW re-intercepts because the path still
// contains /wp-content/uploads/, this hook fires again, and we 302
// in a loop until ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS.
//
// Streaming the body through PHP — chunk by chunk via
// CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION — keeps memory bounded for big media (the
// browser sees a single same-origin response with the image bytes,
// no redirect for the SW to mangle, and we never load a 100MB video
// into PHP memory before the first byte hits the wire).
